      <description>Yes guys, I&amp;rsquo;m back.
Anyways, I recently had an idea and made this render: Not my best, but lets talk about how I made it.
Trees of Light For this, I used Bforartists 3.4, which is based off of Blender 3.5. Immediately I noticed a slowdown in viewport responsiveness. Thinking it was a driver, I went from Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s Studio drivers to their Game Ready drivers, but no difference.
Sidenote: Nvidia has 2 drivers, Studio and Game Ready.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s now New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, so I made a new years render: This is perhaps the most complicated render I have done to date. I started just before Christmas and finished in about 3 to 4 days.
Hologram Shenanigans One of the things I wanted to do was 3D holograms, because I&amp;rsquo;ve never done that before. I first followed a Blender Guru tutorial, and the final node setup does essentially the following:</description>

      <description>I recently had the motivation to make the following render
As you can see, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of reflections, some long test, volumetrics, and other stuff. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t do much Minecraft rendering anymore, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll impart some insight into some of the more technial bits.
GCC&amp;rsquo;s Time to Shine &amp;ldquo;GCC?&amp;rdquo;
Basically, I needed to make a lot of text. Now, I could slam my keyboard a couple of times, but as a nerd I felt like it was the perfect oppertunity to use C++ to generate long text.</description>
