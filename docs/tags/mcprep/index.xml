      <description>As the MCprep 3.4.2 release date draws nearer, I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to remind users how MCprep development works, and how important it is that MCprep receives supports from the community. I feel like people have forgotten how much work goes into MCprep, and I think a little reminder wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt.
Overview Currently, MCprep only has 2 active maintainers (TheDuckCow and myself). While the MCprep GitHub repo says there&amp;rsquo;s 7, most of them haven&amp;rsquo;t contributed in a while: Now obviously TheDuckCow would have the most commits (411 at the time of writing this) since he&amp;rsquo;s been working on MCprep for almost 10 years now (yes, MCprep has been around for 10 years), with myself being behind with 96 commits.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: As of March 11th, 2023, most of these are now confirmed for the 3.4.2 release
As some of you know, I&amp;rsquo;m an MCprep developer, and as part of what I do I work on adding features and fixing bugs in MCprep. Not that, I also help review pull requests and fix bugs.
The latest version of MCprep, MCprep v3.4.1 was released in August of last year. While it may seem like MCprep development is dying, that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from the truth.</description>
