            <description>Hi guys, I think yall might be confused why I&amp;rsquo;ve created a new website, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about it.
But first, what&amp;rsquo;s been going on recently?
Well in short, chaos. The actual situation is much longer, but to put it simply Twitter is no longer (in my opinion) a sustainable platform to remain on, so I moved to Mastodon.
Now because Mastodon allows you to verify your own sites, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone ahead and made this new one, since I felt like it.</description>

<p>Of course, some of you may have also noticed that I&rsquo;m not really doing much 3D. In short, I haven&rsquo;t had much time or motivation to continue working on 3D (but I&rsquo;m getting there, hopefully I&rsquo;ll think of something for New Years). I think I&rsquo;ll try this blogging thing for a bit (I did want to make some in depth guides to Cycles optimization and MCprep itself).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also learning how this Hugo thing (what I use to make this) works, so hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to get my renders back up and running. It&rsquo;ll be a pain and a hassle, but I think it&rsquo;ll be worth it.</p>
