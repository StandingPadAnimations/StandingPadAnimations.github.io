      <description>Introduction We know Cycles is a pain in the butt to render. Specifically, the long render times. Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s tons of videos that talk about what settings to use, but those videos don&amp;rsquo;t explain what the settings do. So, exactly what settings do what?
Samples What are samples? In a nutshell, samples are rays, and the sample count represents how many rays are released by Cycles per pixel+ of the camera (yes Cycles starts from the camera as an optimization, all optical systems can be reversed).</description>

But first, what&amp;rsquo;s been going on recently?
Well in short, chaos. The actual situation is much longer, but to put it simply Twitter is no longer (in my opinion) a sustainable platform to remain on, so I moved to Mastodon.
Now because Mastodon allows you to verify your own sites, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone ahead and made this new one, since I felt like it.</description>
