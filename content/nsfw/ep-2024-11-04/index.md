Well this is a first, I don't normally do NSFW stuff here. I had yesterday
and today off, and I couldn't really think of anything else to make, so
here we are.

Due to restrictions in Ko-Fi's terms of service, this file won't be available
for supporters to download. Sorry about that, but those are the rules.

## Golden Ratio

For this particular render, I
decided to go all in on using the golden ratio, specifically I enabled
both triangle guides and the golden ratio grid, then used intersections
to guide where I placed objects, and likes for positioning. I did use
the spiral as well in tandem with the triangles and grid, but more-so
for the tail, which is positioned in the inner parts of the spiral.

Why did I go with the golden ratio? Because spirals are cool.

To be clear, the golden ratio isn't magic, unlike what much of the internet
wants people to believe, but it does make for a nice twist oan the normal
rule of thirds. Maybe for new year's I'll use the [Riemann zeta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function)
as a guide for composition.
