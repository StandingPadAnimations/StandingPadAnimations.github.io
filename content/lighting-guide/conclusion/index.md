Was learning some lighting tips from a Minecraft artist that bad? Probably somewhat, but even if you learned nothing, I got you to read this series :D

There's many other resources on learning how to master lighting, this is just one. I personally recommend [Andrew Price's series on lighting,](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgH9vCr47kSS5W8PEJBNIiwK) as he goes in depth about more Blender specifics. In addition, Pixar's [Khan Academy course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/pixar/art-of-lighting) is also an amazing course on what I like to call “Light Theory”.

I hope this “guide” will encourage you to go on a journey to master a skill that's commonly forgotten about. 

Cya!
