Holy shit, you found this place? I think I should explain.

Snowflake is a Tor proxy that uses WebRTC to allow users to bypass censorship. More can be explained here: https://snowflake.torproject.org/

In short, it's one of the easiest and safest ways to contribute to Tor. There's no legal issues since Snowflakes just act as a bridge to the rest of Tor, and they help people bypass censorship.

While this page does require allowing 3rd party frames (thus breaking my vow of allowing this website to work 100% with Ublock Origin Medium and Hard modes), I think it's a good idea for me to provide this on my website, as I'm lucky to live in a country with little censorship.

To use, simply enable Snowflake, and keep this tab open.
