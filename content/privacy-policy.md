StandingPad.org measures page traffic with [GoatCounter](https://goatcounter.com), which is [open source](https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter) under a modified version the [European Union Public License](https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter/blob/master/LICENSE). [GoatCounter's privacy policy](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/privacy) goes in depth, but here's the gist.

Every unique visitor is considered the same individual for 8 hours. Afterwards, GoatCounter will consider an individual to be a different person. Cookies are not used, only IP addresses, and all information is anonymized and can not be traced back to an individual for GDPR complience (see [here](https://goatcounter.com/help/gdpr) for more details).

The following information is collected and retained:
- Visited Page
- `Referrer` header
- Browser User-Agent and OS 
- Screen size
- Country (derived from IP only), but not Region

We also respect the `Do-Not-Track` header, should you choose to enable it, and blockers such as [Ublock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).
