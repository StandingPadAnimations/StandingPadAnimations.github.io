# Analytics
StandingPad.org measures page traffic with [GoatCounter](https://goatcounter.com), which is [open source](https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter) under a modified version the [European Union Public License](https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter/blob/master/LICENSE). [GoatCounter's privacy policy](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/privacy) goes in depth, but here's the gist.

Every unique visitor is considered the same individual for 8 hours. Afterwards, GoatCounter will consider an individual to be a different person. Cookies are not used for analytics, only IP addresses (which are hashed when stored to reduce traceability), and all information is anonymized and can not be traced back to an individual for GDPR complience (see [here](https://goatcounter.com/help/gdpr) for more details).
