# Web Designers
These are people who emailed me with web design offers. If you're a web designer, don't email me, I'm not interested.

"But I know Wordpress" - This website doesn't use Wordpress. \
"But SEO" - I actually care about my content. \
"I know JS" - You mean using JavaScript frameworks that add gigabytes of bloat? \
"I can improve your website" - You mean bog it down with the latest and most buggy JavaScript frameworks that fit the latest trends?

Just shut up, I'm not interested.
