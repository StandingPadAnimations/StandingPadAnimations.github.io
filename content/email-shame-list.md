This is a list of all email addresses that have sent me adverts or spam in the past to my email address (`contact@standingpad.org`), and as such have been blocked.

If your email is on here, shame on you. On the bright side, you can tell your parents you're such a jerk that you've achieved the most recognition you'll ever receive in your lives.

# App Developers
These are people who emailed me with offers to make apps. I don't have a reason for an Android or iOS app, so don't bother emailing me.

# Web Designers and Brand Promoters
These are people who emailed me with web design and brand promoting offers. If you're a web designer or a brand promoter, don't email me, I'm not interested. I know you're all from India and use bots (because otherwise my analytics service would be telling me I'm doing well based on the amount of emails I get) to grab emails from websites and spam the crap out of people.

"But I know Wordpress" - This website doesn't use Wordpress. \
"But SEO" - I actually care about my content. \
"I know JS" - You mean using JavaScript frameworks that add gigabytes of bloat? \
"I can improve your website" - I know for a fact you've never seen it with your own eyes, unless you've somehow evaded analytics 10^10 times. \
"Let us increase your profits" - 0 times 100 is still 0

Also if you address me as "Domain Owner", that's automatically means you don't care enough to actually dig around the website and learn about who I am, so why should I care about you?

Just shut up, I'm not interested.

# Crypto Scams
I may be playing around with Monero, but I don't use crypto services, so these are clear scams.

# General Phishing Scams
Most of these people are stupid and say "Dear Domain Owner" instead of addressing me by name.

# Unsolicited Advertisements
My email is not for advertisement junk, it's for actual correspondence.
