## Major Pieces
Since December 2023, I've been doing 2 major pieces a year, one on summer and one in winter, noted with a black border. These are pieces where I try and break my limits, and demonstrate what I've learned in the past several years.

### 2023
2023 only had one major piece, the winter piece for New Years
