> _Foreword: For those unaware, Ahmadi Muslims like myself are considered heretics by parts of the Islamic world, particurally in Pakistan. Ideally, I wouldn't have to write this, but there's bound to be people that dislike myself calling myself Muslim. As this is specifically written for other Muslims that may dislike my use of the term "Muslim", there is a lot of references to religion here._

Some mainstream Muslims may not like the use of the term "Ahmadi _Muslim_" on the [about page](/about), since many mainstream Muslims are taught that us Ahmadis are non-Muslims and "not allowed to be called Muslim"

**Short answer**: I consider myself a Muslim and thus won't remove any references to that on this website

**Longish answer**: On one hand, we don't believe the Prophet Muhammad (saw) to be the final prophet of all time (although we do believe there won't be any new law bearing prophet), we follow a caliph, and we have some unorthodox beliefs compared to other mainstream Muslims. On the other hand:
- We follow all 5 pillars of faith
- We believe God is one and the Prophet Muhammad (saw) is his messenger (as per the kalima)
- We do all 5 daily prayers
- We read the same Quran as every other Muslim (contrary to what some have claimed, we don't have a replacement for the Quran)
- We believe the Quran is the word of God
- We act on the Sunnah of the Prophet (saw) to the best of our abilities
- We believe in the Day of Judgement
- Etc.

In addition, while we don't interpret "Seal of Prophets" to mean the Prophet Muhammad (saw) was the last prophet (rather interpreting it to mean he is the model for all prophets), we still believe that he is the last law bearing prophet, and that any future prophets will merely come to keep Islam from collapsing (similar to how the Isrealites had several non-law bearing prophets). In terms of how much respect we give to the Prophet (saw), it's ingrained to us from childhood to say "ṣallā-llāhu ʿalayhī wa-sallam" at the mere mention of his name, among other things.

Heck, most Muslims don't even realize I'm an Ahmadi unless I tell them, that's how similar we are. I have also had several non-Ahmadi Quran teachers growing up, and for about 3ish years went to an Islamic summer camp (again not ran by Ahmadi Muslims). I'd say 98% of our beliefs are similar to mainstream Islam (on the Sunni branch), and yet there's still a debate over our identity for the remaining 2%. 

To me, based on the above, I'd say I am a Muslim. For those that still want me to remove or censor references to myself as "Muslim" on this website, I have 2 options for you:
1. Make a userscript that removes all occurences of the word Muslim. I won't make one because that's censorship
2. Find someone else to support, not me
