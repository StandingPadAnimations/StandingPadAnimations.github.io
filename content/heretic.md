> _Foreword: For those unaware, Ahmadi Muslims like myself are considered heretics by parts of the Islamic world, particurally in Pakistan. Ideally, I wouldn't have to write this, but there's bound to be people that dislike myself calling myself Muslim. As this is specifically written for other Muslims that may dislike my use of the term "Muslim", there is a lot of references to religion here._

Some Muslims may not like the use of the term "Ahmadi _Muslim_" on the [about page](/about), among other places. After all, many religious clerics and Islamic governments have declared us Ahmadi Muslims as heritics, to the point where in places like Pakistan (the country my parents are from), it's punishable by imprisonment (Ordinance XX of Pakistan) or death (Pakistan's Blasphemy Law) for us to call ourselves Muslims. 

**Short answer**: I consider myself a Muslim and thus won't remove any references to that on this website. If you don't like that, then find another artist to support

**Long answer**: Generally the answer you'll get from other Muslims is mixed. On one hand, we don't believe the Prophet Muhammad (saw) to be the final prophet of all time (although we do believe there won't be any new law bearing prophet), we follow a caliph, and we have some unorthodox beliefs compared to other Muslims (such as the belief that Isa (as) was placed on the cross but survived). On the other hand and:
- We follow all 5 pillars of faith (to the best of our ability at least given the current state of affairs)
- We believe God is one and the Prophet Muhammad (saw) is his messenger (as per the kalima)
- We do all 5 daily prayers
- We read the same Quran as every other Muslim (contrary to what some have claimed, we don't have a "replacement" Quran)
- We believe the Quran is the word of God
- We act on the Sunnah of the Prophet (saw) to the best of our abilities

Heck, most Muslims don't even realize I'm an Ahmadi unless I tell them, that's how similar we are.

In addition, while we don't interpret "Seal of Prophets" to mean the Prophet Muhammad (saw) was the last prophet (rather interpreting it to mean he is the model for all prophets), we still believe that he is the last law bearing prophet, and that any future prophets will merely come to keep Islam from collapsing. That however does not mean we don't hold him in high regard; on the contrary, in my experience, we hold him in such high regard it's practically ingrained to us from childhood to say "ṣallā-llāhu ʿalayhī wa-sallam" at the mere mention of his name, among other things.

To me, based on the above, I'd say I am a Muslim. For those that still consider me a heretic and want me to remove or censor references to Muslim on this website, I have 2 options for you:
1. Make a userscript that removes all occurences of the word Muslim. I won't make one because that's censorship
2. Simply not visit this website at all, you have the freedom to go to any other webpage
