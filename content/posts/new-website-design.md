"Hey what the hell happened here?"

I've updated the website for the first time in a while. I was browsing through hugo themes and saw this really nice one:
{{< github repo="nunocoracao/blowfish" >}}

So after some painful migration, we've now gotten this new website. I've also went ahead and updated the older posts to take advantage of the new theme.

Hope y'all enjoy!

In addition to the new website layout, I've also migrated my lighting guide over here as well. Sadly that means no more PDF version, but the web version looks 10 times better. I've embedded the articles below, but you can also find them [here]({{< ref "resources" >}}) (just click the "Lighting Guide" button)
