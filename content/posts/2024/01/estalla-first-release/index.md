I'm proud to announce a new addon called Estella, which aims to improve working with light linking and light groups.

As we know, Blender's light linking UI isn't really the best, as it requires selecting lights individually. That might be ok for a small scene, but what about a large scene with tons of lights? That's where Estella really shines.

The light linking UI for Estella is based on Maya's UI, which does light linking extremely well.

In the future, Estella will also implement a object centric UI for light linking, which Blender does not provide.

Estella also improves light groups by providing features that Blender doesn't. This includes: 
- Isolating light groups
- Renaming light groups
- Toggling visibility for light groups
- etc

Through this, Estella is able to turn light groups from a clunky to an absolute joy to use.
