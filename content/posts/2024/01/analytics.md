Hey y'all, it's been a while since my last website update (beyond a couple of changes to the background image). This update comes with 2 things:
- Analytics to track page views
- Removal of comments

For analytics, we're tracking page views through GoatCounter, which is open source. More info can be found on the [privacy policy](/privacy-policy) for this website, but the tldr is that no personally identifiable information (that could be traced back to an individual) is collected. The reason I'm implementing analytics is to get an idea of what people actually want to read, so maintaining this website doesn't end up being boring.

As for comments, they're being removed because no one used them, and there's no real point to them. 

That's all I have, cya!
