Yep, I got hired for an paid summer internship at [VLK Architects](https://vlkarchitects.com/) (A local architecture firm in Texas specializing in designing spaces for K-12 education) and will be starting Monday June 10th. This is my first 3D related job, and (from what I've been told) will heavily involve Unreal Engine. 

(Yes, I was surprised too, but it makes sense given the massive new features in UE 5)

Hip hip hurray!
