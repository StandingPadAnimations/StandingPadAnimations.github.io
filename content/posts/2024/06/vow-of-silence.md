As the title suggests, I have decided to take a vow of silence IRL. I have reasons, but I don't think it's important to delve into those here.

For interactions on the internet, this doesn't change much, beyond MCprep developer meetings.

I haven't decided when I'll end it; a month, half a year, a year, or perhaps longer? I don't know.

That's all I have, cya.
