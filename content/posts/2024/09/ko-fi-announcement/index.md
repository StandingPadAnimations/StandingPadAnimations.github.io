I've finally gotten my Ko-Fi page fully set up! Anyone who wants to support can
do so [here](https://ko-fi.com/standingpad).

I also have a [basic monthly tier](https://ko-fi.com/standingpad/tiers) set up for
5 USD a month. Monthly supporters have access to all major piece blend files (although
word of warning, some of these files are huge), as well as blend files for anything
with longer form content on my blog (not everything for now, that's a lot
of stuff to go through, but maybe in the future). These files can be downloaded on
the [Ko-Fi Shop](https://ko-fi.com/standingpad/shop).

That's pretty much all I wanted to say today, cya!
