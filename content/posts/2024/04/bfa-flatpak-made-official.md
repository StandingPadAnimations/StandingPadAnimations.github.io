Yep, you heard that right, the Bforartists Flatpak is now official... because I've returned to the Bforartists development team :tada:

A bit of historical context for those unaware, the Bforartists Flatpak was, although endorsed, technically considered unofficial due to some conflicts between upstream and I (which I take full responsibility for). Although there was still some level of coordination between myself and the Bforartists team for packaging, the Flatpak still operated independently from the main project. This has been the general state of the Bforartists Flatpak for about a year now.

About a week ago (to clear my conscious), I sent a short letter to the Bforartists team apologizing for the issues I caused in the past. In response, I was allowed back on the Bforartists team, making the Flatpak officially supported. This brings a couple of changes:
- The Bforartists issue tracker will now be used for the Flatpak instead of the Flathub repo 
- The Flathub listing for Bforartists will now say "Bforartists" as the author (verification is planned as well)

In the future, I plan to eventually take over packaging for Bforartists on Linux in general, once I get powerful enough hardware (namely RAM) for compiling Bforartists.

Cya!
