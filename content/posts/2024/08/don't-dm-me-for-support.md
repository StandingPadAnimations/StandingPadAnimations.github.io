A lot of times on Blender communities, I'll get DMs from people wanting support
for their issue. I'm not sure why me specifically (I'm a Minecraft artist),
but it happens, and usually goes something like this:

```txt
Person 1: Bro please help me with this issue
```

So I'll say it here: please don't DM me for support,
I'm probably going to ignore it. If it's a matter that absolutely needs my attention,
and you don't want to tag me publicly on a server (which I would prefer),
your best route is to [email me](mailto:contact@standingpad.org) (also on the
home page of my website). Unlike DMs on platforms like Discord, emails are easier
for me to archive and keep a paper trail of what comes through. Plus, I check my
emails everyday.

Of source, some might ask "if you don't like DMs so much, why have them enabled?".
I actually used to keep them closed, but that became very annoying in the long run.
Sadly, platforms like Discord are all or nothing when it comes to DMs on a per-server
basis, so keeping DMs closed is just impractical for me.

Tldr: please don't DM me if you need Blender support, either tag me publicly on a
server or email me privately if absolutely necessary.
