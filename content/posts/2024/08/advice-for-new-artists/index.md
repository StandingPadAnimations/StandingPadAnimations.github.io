tldr: Learn to step back for a little bit when you feel your art is crap

Over the past few years, I've seen many artists come and go in the Minecraft
rendering community, and there's one thing said that seems to be constant:
> This sucks.

Pretty much every artist at some point will say this with regards to their own art,
especially when they start to start looking at other artists of varying skill sets,
and to be honest, it's fricking annoying, so I'll say this:

Take a step back. Seriously, take a step back for a few hours from your art and come
back later. Trust me, it'll help a lot.

I call this the Good Shit Law (excuse the language for just a moment):
> What looks shit now will look good with fresh eyes.

Now why did I make this? Well because recently I took a second look at something
I made back in July that I thought was absolutely garbage, and you know what, it
didn't look as bad as I thought it was back then.

I was originally going to present it as an option for the MCprep 3.6 release artwork,
but at the time decided that it was garbage and thus scrapped it (it was also 1 AM).
However, taking a second look at it, I think it looks decent enough to post online
now.

That's pretty much all I wanted to write this time around, cya!
