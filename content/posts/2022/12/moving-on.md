Hi guys, I think yall might be confused why I've created a new website, let's talk about it.

But first, what's been going on recently?

Well in short, chaos. The actual situation is much longer, but to put it simply Twitter is no longer (in my opinion) a sustainable platform to remain on, so I moved to Mastodon. 

Now because Mastodon allows you to verify your own sites, I've gone ahead and made this new one, since I felt like it.

Of course, some of you may have also noticed that I'm not really doing much 3D. In short, I haven't had much time or motivation to continue working on 3D (but I'm getting there, hopefully I'll think of something for New Years). I think I'll try this blogging thing for a bit (I did want to make some in depth guides to Cycles optimization and MCprep itself).

I'm also learning how this Hugo thing (what I use to make this) works, so hopefully I'll be able to get my renders back up and running. It'll be a pain and a hassle, but I think it'll be worth it.
