Hey there, if you're from Instagram and never been on my website, then welcome (I've had this for almost a year now). There's some updates I got to talk about.

First off I'll be deleting my Instagram account in a couple days. There's a couple of reasons for it, but it mostly boils down to Meta now requiring an account to view posts. When it comes to posting content online, I go by the following philosophy "use the lowest barrier possible", and there's a reason for that. I don't want to be the reason someone makes an account for a service they weren't going to use anyway. Since Meta is now requiring accounts to view posts, I don't want to post on Instagram anymore. I don't post much there anyway (we'll get to that in a second), nor do I trust Meta anyways (I literally run Instagram in a seperate browser on a completely seperate computer). I'll be posting my renders here now, which has the added bonus that I can talk a lot more about the process (and no image compression either!).

I mentioned how I don't post much online anymore, and like everything there's a reason for that. It's extremely difficult for me to do 3D art nowadays.

The first thing to understand is that the system I use to render (which has all of my files) is a shared system, shared between me and some other family members. The person that uses it the most (who I'll call \\(dx\\) cause they're as painful to deal with as calculus) is a gamer, and over the past year or so they've been replacing the components of the system (not the actual PC itself, just stuff like the mouse and keyboard). As a result, they feel like they own the system completely now, and use it for hours at a time. As such, for me to render, I have to wait months for a time when \\(dx\\) won't be on it for even a little bit of time.

Now here's the problem: \\(dx\\) really does not want me to be rendering anymore (it's been the case for a year and a half now). Why I have no idea, but frankly that's just how it is. I am older (much older in fact), but they're twice my size, and will always use the "I've bought most of the parts" argument (even though again, the actual PC itself is shared, they have no ownership over it). This meant that for the past year and a half, I've had no access to the system I use for rendering, including 3+ years worth of files and assets (about 40+ GB), which makes rendering on my laptop much harder. In the past I've tried to transfer those files, but to no avail (at least in a way that wouldn't piss off \\(dx\\)). They don't want to negotiate, they don't want to split time, they just want to do what gamers do all day. 

"But Standing, didn't you say every couple of months you get an oppertunity?"

Yes, but only for a few hours, which causes the following problems:
- Worse art.
- Too much sitting (did I mention \\(dx\\) is one of those "if you're off the chair you're not using it" gamers?), which is not good health wise (especially cause I already sit a lot daily).
- Sleep deprevation; it doesn't help that the only times \\(dx\\) is not gaming is at 10 PM, and often I end up working till midnight on a render. I've already felt the worse effects of sleep deprevation with my memory (for any kids reading this, please sleep well, you don't want to end up like me and forget decades of your life).

At this point, I think I'm going to have to throw in the towel, at least until I solve the files and assets problem. I'm too tired to be dealing with \\(dx\\)'s shenanigans. If that means less Blender content, so be it. I got better things to do then waste time dealing with \\(dx\\), which leads me to explain what's going to happen here.

I'll still be posting here, there's no doubt about it. I got a couple of things planned, including some new posts on Cycles optimization (I started a series of posts here on it last December, but haven't touched it since) and some expansion on the [lighting guide](/lighting-guide) to add some stuff I missed, especially light linking (now that Blender 4.0 has it). I'm also working with TheDuckCow on some MCprep development changes (but I'll save those for him to announce), and I've been working on some projects (but again I'll save those for later). That means there's going to be a lot less Blender content here. I'll be posting last render here hopefully by the end of this week, but I've left a preview in the article thumbnail.

If you want to get notifications for new posts, then there's 2 ways. The first and most preferable way is RSS (yes I'm old school), and the second way is following me on Mastodon (all of my socials are avalible [on the main page where all of the icons are](/), as well as my email), but I'd only advise following me on Mastodon if you want to actually use Mastodon (again I don't want to be the reason people make accounts for services they otherwise don't want to use). RSS has the advantage of only requiring an RSS reader, of which there are many.

I know a these updates are a lot to take in, but I hope they were easy to read. Until next time, cya!
