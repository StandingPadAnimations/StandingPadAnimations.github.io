[MCprep 3.5 is now released!](https://github.com/Moo-Ack-Productions/MCprep/releases/tag/3.5.0) I won't go too much in depth on the changes (TheDuckCow can do that better then I can), but it was a long development cycle. We made it to the end though.

Of course a lot of you are probably here because of the splash art that was choosen for MCprep 3.5.
{{< figure src="gallary/mcprep-splash.webp" alt="MCprep splash screen for MCprep 3.5. It is of my OC Kaiyona reading a book in a cafe with a slice of cake" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" width=50% height=auto >}}

This is baed off of an earlier work I did last year:
{{< figure src="gallary/original.webp" alt="Original art of what is now the MCprep splash. It is of my OC Kaiyona reading a book in a cafe with a slice of cake" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" width=50% height=auto >}}

There are however some changes, mostly because the blend file for the splash is distributed to MCprep users:
- Removal of cyborg tail (not really noticable in the original, but it's a hallmark of my work)
- Desaturation of character (your eyes are not tricking you, my OC in the splash is desaturated!)

This actually wasn't the only idea for the splash. In total, I sent 5 works (that worked well with a 16:9 aspect ratio) and we choose from there. To quote TheDuckCow on why this particular piece was chosen:

> {{< typeit 
  speed=20

"Part of my rationale for this one is that it's "reading in a cafe", implies something studious, and how we've been hard at work - for the end user, this update won't feel that different, but it was a big overhaul."
- TheDuckCow
{{< /typeit >}}

Of course, if I didn't have the 16:9 constraint (or really the constraint on landscape), I probably would have chosen this image (mostly because a lot more MCprep features were used here):
{{< figure src="gallary/alternative.webp" alt="Kaiyona resting on a tree while wearing a white dress. She is clearly tired, possibly from the fact Blobby is falling down in the background" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" width=25% height=auto >}}

But I digress.

Before I end this post, I do want to say that I will be taking a break from MCprep, but I have a post with more details on that.

That about wraps it up, Cya!
