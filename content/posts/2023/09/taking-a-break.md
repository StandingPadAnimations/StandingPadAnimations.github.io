[As stated on the MCprep repo](https://github.com/Moo-Ack-Productions/MCprep/discussions/481), I will be taking a break from MCprep for the next development cycle. This also includes the MCprep community server (beyond what is required for me to do my job as a mod).

"As I've noticed in the past year or so, I've grown a bitâ€¦ harsh on other people, and I think a break will really help with that issue."
- Me
{{< /typeit >}}

I think however I should elaborate on the reasoning a bit more. 

In the past, I've noticed that I get pretty... what's the best word for this?
> {{< typeit 
  speed=20
>}}
critical
1. inclined to find fault or to judge with severity, often too readily
- Dictionary.com
{{< /typeit >}}

Yeah let's go with that. Needless to say, it's not a good thing when dealing with MCprep users, and really has caused me more issues. 

There's another layer to this though: around fall and winter my emotional state tends to get a bit more... what's the right word?
> {{< typeit 
  speed=20
>}}
melancholy
1. a gloomy state of mind, especially when habitual or prolonged; depression
- Dictionary.com
{{< /typeit >}}

Before y'all get concerned, it's nothing to be concerned about, but arounnd winter my emotional state doesn't tend to fare well. It wasn't as bad last year, but I have a feeling it's going to be pretty bad this year (cause I'm old now :D). I don't want that to make my issue of being too critical on people even worse.

For now I've decided on the entirity of the next MCprep development cycle, but who knows how the future will turn out? Perhaps I might skip another if it gets to it. 

I think that's really all for me to say, cya!
