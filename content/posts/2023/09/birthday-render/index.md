My birthday was 8 days ago, but sadly I couldn't do some rendering on that day, so here's a late birthday piece to me:
{{< image src="gallary/BirthdayTimdWatermarked.png" alt="Render of Kaiyona being handed a cake. She's tying her hair (while holding her hairband with her mouth) blushing" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Enjoy!
