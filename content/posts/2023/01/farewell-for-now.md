I just don't know how else to put it, I'm leaving the Minecraft animation world. After what David RB has done, I feel that it's not right for me to continue. 

For anyone that hasn't heard, David RB, the original owner of Black Plasma Studios, has recently been exposed for being abusive and grooming a minor.

I initially refrained from making a stance, but after reviewing [the evidence released by Posidon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWV90K8-HD8), I've decided I can no longer refrain from making a stance.

What David did was absolutely horrific, and may he be cursed till his final breath.

After everything that has happened, I do not feel right continuing Minecraft rendering. Some may object to this, but this has been haunting me for the past 12+ hours, and I think it's for the best. This also means I will stop working on MCprep. I know that leaves [2](https://github.com/TheDuckCow/MCprep/pull/334) [pull requests](https://github.com/TheDuckCow/MCprep/pull/348) unfinished, but I think the open source community will get them done eventually.

Will I return eventually? That's up to fate to decide.
Will I stop posting on this blog? No, but things will be changing.

I know it feels disingenuous to not leave y'all with a render, but I don't feel like making one, so here's [the files of the renders I feel like releasing](https://www.mediafire.com/file/50wf9xvrfphgdq7/Only+renders.7z/file) (note that there's 2 scenes in each file, Scene and Compositing). If you want the file for a specific render, just DM me on Instagram (or email me if you prefer) and I'll try to find and send it to you. You can find those [here](https://standingpadanimations.github.io/).

Well, I guess that's all I have to say about this, farewell Minecraft animation community. Till we meet again.
