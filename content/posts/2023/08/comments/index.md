Today I've now added comments to my website! You can try them out on the bottom of this post.

"Wait I need GitHub for comments >:C"

Ok slight caveat, GitHub is needed for comments. The comments section takes advantage of GitHub Discussions (in fact, the discussion for this page is [here](https://github.com/StandingPadAnimations/StandingPadAnimations.github.io/discussions/2)), so a GitHub account is needed. Hey, less spam.

Since it's based off of GitHub Discussions, you can use the [entire GitHub Markdown Spec](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github), so there's a lot of options for formatting comments. Oh, and you can add reactions to this post as well. Enjoy!
