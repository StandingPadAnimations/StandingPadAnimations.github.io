"Hey why are all of the images reloading now?"

So this past day I've updated all of the URLs on this website to use the scheme `/posts/year/month/article` over `/posts/article`. In addition, I've also moved all of the images from `/static/imgs` to `/post/year/month/article/gallary`. All in all, this means the browser's cached version of this website is no longer valid and now everything has to be reloaded.

I apologize for any inconvinience this may cause.
