Hey y'all, it's been a while since I've written on the blog, so here's some updates.

# Website Updates
I've now updated the website to use a proper domain. In the past, the domain for the website was at 30 characters (`standingpadanimations.github.io`), which wasn't memorable, so I've purchased a domain for the website and now it's simply https://standingpad.org. That should hopefully make it easier to remember this place.

# Blender
I've began work on a piece for new years (basically a tradition at this point). Why this early? Well...

Yeah, I'm doing this all on a laptop, so I need the extra time. That being said, I've gotten a good amount of stuff done so far.
