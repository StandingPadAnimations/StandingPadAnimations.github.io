Happy holidays everyone! Sorry I couldn't post yesterday (it was my dad's birthday and birthdays + Christmas Eve don't really mix well).

Of course, I myself don't celebrate Christmas (cultural reasons) so I'm just waiting for New Years. I've been working on a New Years render, so here's a WIP

It's also the second week of winter break for me, which means in about a week I'll have to return back to doing IRL stuff. Not sure how I'll continue writing, but I'll figure it out eventually.

Speaking of IRL stuff, my Rust crate [Resurgence](https://github.com/Resurgence-VM-Development/Resurgence) (a virtual machine backend that can easily be embeded in a Rust project) is almost ready for its first alpha. I don't think I've ever talked about it on my old website (let alone here), not sure why as it's a big part of what I do normally.

I think for the rest of this week I'll be working on MCprep/Resurgence and some IRL work I have remaining. 

That's pretty much all I have to write about today, cya!
