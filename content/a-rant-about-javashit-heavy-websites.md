*Originally made on the Erindale.XYZ server, I've since copied it here and cleaned it up to make it easier to share*

***Warning: Intense amount of swearing used here***

There's 3 types of websites:
- Websites with no JavaShit (like the Plan9 UNIX website)
- Websites with a very tiny amount of JavaShit where absolutely needed (like this website)
- Websites with a shit ton of JavaShit and won't show any content if you have 3rd party JavaShit disabled 

The 3rd type, are what I fucking hate the most. Those stupid motherfucking websites that somehow get to the top of the search results but when I open them go "please enable JavaShit in your browser in order to view the content :)" like for fuck's sake if you can show that message, you can show the whole goddamn webpage. Those are the same websites whose developers go "wait disabled people exist?" or "wait, dyslexic people prefer being able to use their own fonts?" as if it isn't fucking 2024. 

This also includes websites made with any GUI because seriously those things are as bloated as a fucking T-Rex, I absolutely hate those. Like ok, cool that you don't want to fucking learn web technologies to make a website because you're too lazy to, but guess what, I can't fucking load your website because of whatever shit your GUI website generator uses. You don't even need stuff like Wix and Google Sites at this point; I'm far from a web developer, and this entire website is made in markdown, converted to HTML with Hugo, and styled using a modified Hugo theme. And guess what, it's fucking fast. I can go all the way to fucking Lahore in Pakistan, with some of the slowest internet speeds in the world (because it's fucking Pakistan), and I'll still be able to view this website will load as fast as it does in the US. And yes, I've fucking done that, and it's true.

ALSO, WHY ON EARTH DO THOSE PAGES HAVE A SHIT TON OF LAYOUT SHIFTS, like have these developers never heard of the `width` and `height` properties in the `image` ta- oh wait, they haven't, they use whatever the hottest JavaShit framework is out right now, they don't give a shit about user experience. By the time those fucking piece of shit websites load on my phone and my finger presses a link, it goes to a completely different place then I fucking intended because the fucking layout shift occurs right when I place my finger on the link (looking at you GitHub and your fucking obsession with layout shifts)

Also, why the fuck are icons now made with fucking fonts, are they trying to give more stress to the already fucking stressed networks, like have they not heard of fucking SVGs or you know, NOT USING A FUCKING WEBFONT. ALSO, THEY ALL SOURCE THEIR FONTS FROM FUCKING GOOGLE FONTS, BECAUSE I GUESS INCLUDING THE FONT IN `static` IS NOT WHAT THE COOL KIDS DO. Like seriously, do all of y'all have 100 TB/s speeds, cause clearly you motherfuckers think everyone else has that speed. Guess what? WE. DON'T. ALL. HAVE. GOOD. INTERNET. You hear me? We don't all have fucking 10 TB/s speeds, and we don't give a shit about your 100 MB navigation bar. We just want to fucking view the fucking content.
