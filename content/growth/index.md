For many beginning artists, it's hard to imagine that the people you look up to were once beginners too. In addition, it's easy for experienced artists like myself to feel a bit of impostor syndrome at our work and forget how far we've gone, so I've created this page of my growth over the years.

It's a bit embarrassing (especially 2020-2021/22), but every artist feels that way about their old work.

## 2020
First year of Blender... for a bit of context, Songs of War was still a big thing at this time, and was one of the reasons I started Blender. Well, if I'm being truthful, I just saw a cool Minecraft rig on Twitter (Thomas Animations Rig). Didn't know what Blender was, but I downloaded it (I'm a bit of a file hoarder, I know) to play around with it. Ironically I'm not a big fan of the rig, but I have to thank it for starting my 3D art career.
