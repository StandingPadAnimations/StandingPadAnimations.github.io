Hi, I guess you're here for the source code

This website uses Hugo to build.

The actual code pushed to Github Pages is found in `/docs`. Everything else is what I actually write (Hugo builds the code that is ultimately pushed and is what you see)

Since this website is entirely HTML, that means that technically, you can actually set Ublock Origin to Medium Mode (or higher if you so desire), which is what I do.
